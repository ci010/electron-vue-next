# Overview

This repository contains the starter template for using vue-next with the latest electron. 

*I started to learn electron & vue by the great project [electron-vue](https://github.com/SimulatedGREG/electron-vue). This project is also inspired from it.*

You can see the document [here](https://ci010.github.io/electron-vue-next/index.html).

同样，我们也有[中文文档](https://ci010.github.io/electron-vue-next/zh)。

  - Wait until it has great support for vuex and router to add it

## Getting Started

Run `npm init electron-vue-next`

Once you have your project, and in the project folder:

```shell
# Install dependencies with linter
npm install

# Will start vite server, rollup devserver, and electron to dev!
npm run dev

# OPTIONAL. Will compile the main and renderer process to javascript and display output size
npm run build

# OPTIONAL. Will compile all and output an unpacked electron app. You can directly 
npm run build:dir

# Will compile all and build all products and ready to release
npm run build:production

```
